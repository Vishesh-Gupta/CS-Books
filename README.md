# CS-Books

This repository talk about books I want to read and am reading which have been recommended by a lot of people in the industry.

I am plannig to cover the books by writing the Algorithms, solving the exercises in my free time, and putting them out here for everyone to read.

## Purpose

Purpose of doing so is just to share a compressed version of things and a quick way to see good books and if someone else is stuck with the same problem, what I did to solve the specific challenge.

The few books I plan to cover are:

1. Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick
2. Introduction to Algorithms (MIT publication) by Thomas H. Cormen et. Al
3. Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow by O'Reilly.
4. Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces
5. Siz Easy Pieces
6. Steve and Rago
7. Linux device drivers, third edition
8. Lean Startup
9. Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom
10. Introduction to Cryptology, Springer
11. The Elements of statistical learning, Springer


Other than that there will be links to problems these Algorithms solve and their solutions.
